### Quantum OTP
### This project uses Quantum physical processes to generate true randomness number OTP.

### This Python code utilizes several technologies and libraries:
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- Aer
- Time

### Overall, the code combines classical and quantum computing concepts to generate a random number and update a one-time password (OTP) value after a certain duration.
